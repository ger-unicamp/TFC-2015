Module "AD1"       (component ADC)
   - AD1_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_MeasureChan -This method performs measurement on one channel. (Note: If the <number of conversions> is more than one 
                the conversion of the A/D channel is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_GetValue -Returns the last measured values for all channels. Format and width of the value is a native format of the 
                A/D converter.
   - AD1_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - AD1_Calibrate -This method starts self calibration process. Calibration is typically used to remove the effects of the 
                gain and offset from a specific reading.

Module "RxBuf"     (component RingBufferUInt8)
   - RxBuf_Put -Puts a new element into the buffer
   - RxBuf_Get -Removes an element from the buffer
   - RxBuf_NofElements -Returns the actual number of elements in the buffer.
   - RxBuf_NofFreeElements -Returns the actual number of free elements/space in the buffer.
   - RxBuf_Init -Initializes the data structure

Module "AS1"       (component Serial_LDD)
   - AS1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - AS1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission is not 
                completed. Method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled. This method finishes immediately after calling it - it 
                doesn't wait the end of data transmission. Use event <OnBlockSent> to check the end of data transmission or 
                method GetSentDataNum to check the state of sending.
   - AS1_ReceiveBlock -Specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified number of 
                characters is received. Method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive operation. If a 
                receive operation is not in progress (the method was not called or a previous operation has already finished) 
                all received characters will be lost without any notification. To prevent the loss of data call the method 
                immediately after the last receive operation has finished (e.g. from the <OnBlockReceived> event). This method 
                finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data reception. Use event <OnBlockReceived> 
                to check the end of data reception or method GetReceivedDataNum to check the state of receiving.

Module "BigClock"  (component BitIO)
   - BigClock_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - BigClock_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory 
                or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - BigClock_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - BigClock_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if 
                the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "SI"        (component BitIO)
   - SI_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - SI_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or a 
                register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - SI_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - SI_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "LitleClock" (component TimerInt)
   - LitleClock_Enable -This method enables the component - it starts the timer. Events may be generated 
                (<DisableEvent>/<EnableEvent>).
   - LitleClock_Disable -This method disables the component - it stops the timer. No events will be generated.

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU1_Enable -Enables the component - it starts the signal generation. Events may be generated (see SetEventMask). The 
                method is not available if the counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.
   - TU1_Disable -Disables the component - it stops signal generation and events calling. The method is not available if the 
                counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.

Module "PWM1"      (component PWM)
   - PWM1_SetRatio16 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as a 16-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - FFFF 
                value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined 
                values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer possibilities and on 
                the selected period.
   - PWM1_SetDutyUS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in microseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.
   - PWM1_SetDutyMS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in milliseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.

Module "TU2"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU2_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU2_GetPeriodTicks -Returns the number of counter ticks before re-initialization. See also method <SetPeriodTicks>. This 
                method is available only if the property <"Counter restart"> is switched to 'on-match' value.
   - TU2_GetCounterValue -Returns the content of counter register. This method can be used both if counter is enabled and if 
                counter is disabled. The method is not available if HW doesn't allow reading of the counter.
   - TU2_SetOffsetTicks -Sets the new offset value to channel specified by the parameter ChannelIdx. It is user responsibility 
                to use value below selected period. This method is available when at least one channel is configured.
   - TU2_GetOffsetTicks -Returns the number of counter ticks to compare match channel specified by the parameter ChannelIdx. 
                See also method <SetOffsetTicks>. This method is available when at least one channel is configured.
